# Vehicle-Counting-and-Classification-Using-Yolov8
• Developed an automated system to address the challenge of accurate real-time vehicle counting and classification in complex video streams. 
• Implemented a solution using YOLOv8 for object detection and classification, OpenCV for video processing, and a virtual counting line algorithm for precise vehicle tracking.  
• The system successfully detected, classified, and counted various vehicle types in real-time, providing accurate statistics and clear visual feedback while maintaining robustness in challenging environmental conditions.
